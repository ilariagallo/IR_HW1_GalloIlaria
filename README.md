# IR_HW1_GalloIlaria

The folder called "run" contains the results given by Terrier.
The folder called "eval" contains the evaluation metrics from trec_eval, one for each run.
The ANOVA folder contains some code written in Matlab in order to perform the one-way ANOVA statistical test, 
in particular the file ir_anova.m, which takes in input data coming from the trec_eval files (with some preprocessing) 
and gives in output the boxplot and the plot of the Tukey HSD test.
